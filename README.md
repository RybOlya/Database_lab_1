# Database Lab 1
## 
### Create a relational database schema that allows storage information about the elements of the user's solar station 
- type of panel, power, battery capacity, duration of use
batteries, panels, etc. 
- station installation address, power production of each panel hourly every day, battery charge level every hour, the current tilt angles of each of the panels 
- quantity of energy sold to the energy market hourly and the price of electricity depending on the time of sale (the price may change). 
### Predict that some panels can change the angle of inclination during the day for the better generation, and the number of farms where solar stations are installed - can be any. 
### Similarly, one owner can have several solar stations, or a station may have several owners
